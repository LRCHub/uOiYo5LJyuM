```lrc
[00:16.78] Better run
[00:18.03] Fall in love
[00:19.95] Just for an afternoon
[00:23.16] Lovin' goes too slow
[00:25.51] Light moves alone
[00:34.01] 
[00:30.45] A song that plays
[00:32.15] Makes me miss
[00:34.03] All that I've lost
[00:37.78] Till the sun goes down
[00:40.25] And the lights go on
[00:50.25] 
[00:44.29] It's feeling I'm fine
[00:49.02] Gone when you're gone
[00:52.54] Hell after this
[00:55.38] Is gone when I'm home
[01:05.88] 
[00:58.65] If I'm going to hell
[01:01.93] After this
[01:07.73] I'm gonna enjoy you while I can
[01:13.18] I won't remember your face
[01:16.85] After this
[01:22.45] I'm gonna enjoy you while I can
[01:37.95] 
[01:30.07] Got a coin and a sun
[01:32.82] Back in time
[01:37.11] Looking up
[01:38.61] Got the sky on my mind
[01:44.44] Have a seat, get a drink
[01:47.96] It's time for a change
[01:52.02] Feels like god is on my side
[02:06.02] 
[01:57.52] It's feeling I'm fine
[02:02.83] Gone when you're gone
[02:06.31] Hell after this
[02:09.07] Is gone when I'm home
[02:19.57] 
[02:12.63] If I'm going to hell
[02:16.53] After this
[02:21.43] I'm gonna enjoy you while I can
[02:27.38] I won't remember your face
[02:30.95] After this
[02:36.59] I'm gonna enjoy you while I can
[02:42.04] If I'm going to hell
[02:45.69] After this
[02:51.27] I'm gonna enjoy you while I can
[03:06.77] 
[03:06.48] I'm gonna enjoy you while I can
[03:21.98] 
[03:21.18] I'm gonna enjoy you while I can
